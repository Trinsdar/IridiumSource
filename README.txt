Simple mod that adds Platina Ore and a way to produce Iridium(IC2) without useless excess ore-products.

Only REAL METEORITE ORE PROCESSING.

Recipes



Insert any of 3 ores in macerator, it will give you 1 Platina Prill



Wash your prill with 8mB of water in Ore Washing Plant, that gives you Iridium-191, Platina-190 and 2 Tiny Piles of Iron Dust



Save your Iridium-191 for later, right now we have to run Platina-190 through the Thermal Centrifuge.
When machine will heat up to 2000hU it will start processing, which gives you Iridium-193 and Tiny Pile of Copper Dust



Easiest part of a process - crafting of Complex Compound from Iridium-191, Iridium-193 and Gold Dust



And the last step, compressing Compound into some Iridium Shard, cool isn't it?



ALL CRAFTING METHODS WERE STOLEN FROM REAL LIFE
